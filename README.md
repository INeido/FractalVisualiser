# FractalVisualiser

Tool to render high resolution images of the Mandelbrot set. Kitted out with multithreading, supersampling and a user interface to navigate yourself around the fractal. It can do up to a ^14 zoom.

## Settings

You can adjust the number of **Threads**. Only tested with 6 cores though.

**Supersampling** goes up to a 7x7 render.

**Sharpen** doesn't really do anything yet. Just like the color settings.

There are a few of **Presets** for cool looking coordinates.

## Sequence

With the **Sequence** option you can create a bunch of automatic screenshots for a cool zoom effect.

# TO-DOs

**A lot.**

Color Palettes, Sharpening, advanced file Explorer, Undo-Redo buttons, draggable image, better Math, longer zoom, etc.

This project is long abondened.
My goal was far too complicated to begin with, but I am surprised how far it has come.
It has already outgrown me, so I probably won't pick it up again, but anyone else if free to improve it or copy from it.
